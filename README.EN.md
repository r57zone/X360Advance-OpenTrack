# X360Advance (XInput) 
Gyroscope for the Xbox gamepad that allows you to use it as a steering wheel, and also help you more accurately aim. You can use any tracker supported by OpenTrack (for example, Arduino + GY-85).<br>
There are 3 modes of use:<br>
1. FPS - offset of the stick by gyroscope slopes (LB + RB + BACK)
2. Steering wheel - complete emulation of the left stick by the gyroscope (LB + RB + START)
3. By default - no gyroscope using (LB + RB + BACK + START)
## Setup
Download and install the latest version of [OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases) and run it.
<br><br>
In OpenTrack settings, you must select you tracker (and setup if need), for example "FreePie UDP receiver", and the output interface: "freetrack 2.0 Enhanced". Then click the "Run" button.
<br><br>
Run the application "XInputTest.exe" to check XInput library. Try tilting the tracker in different directions, switch modes. In OpenTrack, you can configure blind zones and sensitivity (curves and filter).
<br><br>
It is possible that you will have to exchange Yaw, Pitch or Roll in the OpenTrack profile settings.
<br><br>
In the "X360Advance.ini" you can change the sensitivity of the steering wheel and the rotation of the camera for the FPS mode.
<br><br>
After the configuration, you need to copy the files "xinput1_3.dll" (for 32 bit games, and for 64 bit copy "xinput1_3x64.dll" and rename to "xinput1_3.dll") and "X360Advance.ini" to the folder with the game, and run the game. Perhaps for some games you will have to rename "xinput1_3.dll" to one of the names: "xinput1_4.dll" (Windows 8 / metro apps only), "xinput1_2.dll", "xinput1_1.dll" or "xinput9_1_0.dll" .
